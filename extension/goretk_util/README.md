# `goretk_util`

- Uses [gore](https://github.com/goretk/gore)
- Extracts metadata from binaries
- Parses source code (only the standard library at the moment)
- Produces a common JSON output with data type and function information which can be imported into some reverse engineerings suite. For example Ghidra.
